# 🐾 Animal Shelter 🐾

This was an assignment for One Code Camp. It was up to each of us to decide whatever theme we wished for this project.  So I decided to create a mock website for an animal shelter.

## 📋 Assignment #1 - Create a form

Approximate time to complete this assignment = 40 minutes

1. Create a new HTML file named `myForm.html`
2. Create a form on the page.  It should include:
* Text Input
* Number Input
* Dropdown Menu
* Radio Buttons
* Checkboxes
* Text Area
* Disabled Button
* Submit Button
3. Ensure that the user fills out all text input areas before hitting the "Submit" button. Tell them that every detail is essentail!
4. Once you are satisfied with your webpage, create a new repository in GitHub to host it so that it can be shared.
